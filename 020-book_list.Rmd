# Data Visualization

##  ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis
Hadley Wickham

ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics. Unlike most other graphics packages, ggplot2 has an underlying grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2005), that allows you to compose graphs by combining independent components. This makes ggplot2 powerful. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, you can create novel graphics that are tailored to your specific problem.

# R programming
##  Modern R with the tidyverse
Bruno Rodrigues

This book can be useful to different audiences. If you have never used R in your life, and want to start, start with Chapter 1 of this book. Chapter 1 to 3 are the very basics, and should be easy to follow up to Chapter 9. Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the {tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can start with Chapter 4. If you are familiar with R, the {tidyverse} and functional programming, you might still be interested in this book, especially Chapter 9 and 10, which deal with package development and further advanced topics respectively.

## Field Guide to the R Ecosystem
Mark Sellors

This field guide aims to introduce the reader to the main components of the R ecosystem that may be encountered in “the field”.Whatever the reason, whilst there is a wealth of in-depth information for people actually using the language, I could find precious little information that provided the sort of overview of the ecosystem that I know I’d have appreciated when I first came to the language. And with that thought, a field guide is born…

## YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R
Nathaniel D. Phillips

Learn R from the ground up.

Let me make something very, very clear…

I did not write this book.

This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirate’s Guide to R.

## The R Inferno
Patrick Burns

If R's behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for many more surprises, written in the style of Dante. It's a concise report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time spent on explaining why part of behaviour. As mentioned, it's a concise book, 126 books only.

## A sufficient Introduction to R
Derek l. Sonderegger

This book is intended to guide people that are completely new to programming along a path towards a useful skill level using R. I belive that while people can get by with just copying code chunks, that doesn’t give them the background information to modify the code in non-trivial ways. Therefore we will spend more time on foundational details than a “crash-course” would.

## Introduction to R - R spatial 
R Spatial

This document provides a concise introduction to R. It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R much, or if you feel confused.

##  Shiny Production with AWS Book
Business Science

A big problem exists… No one teaches Data Scientists how to deploy web applications. You spend all of this time building Shiny web applications. And then… [silence].

This book alongside the Shiny Developer with AWS Course (DS4B 202A-R) solves this problem - teaching Data Scientists how to deploy, host, and maintain web applications.

# Statistics

##  Common statistical tests are linear models: a work through
Steve Doogue

This is a reworking of the book Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats), written by Jonas Lindeløv. The book beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model. The book also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the rank of values.

# Workflow
##  How I Use R
David Keyes // R for the Rest of Us

There are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle.

Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have. Things like:

How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality? 

This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.

## Agile Data Science with R
Edwin Thoen

I joined a Scrum team (frontend, backend, ux designer, product owner, second data scientist) to create a machine learning model that we brought to production using the Agile principles. It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production.

# Field specific
##  Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R
Marcelo S. Perlin 

Not surprisingly, fields with abundant access to data and practical applications, such as economics and finance, it is expected that a graduate student or a data analyst has learned at least one programming language that allows him/her to do his work efficiently. Learning how to program is becoming a requisite for the job market.
